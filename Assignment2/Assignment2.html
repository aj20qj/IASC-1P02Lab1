			<h1>Dark Souls: Remastered</h1>
			<a id="earlygame"></a>
			<h2>Early Game</h2>
			<p>Dark Souls' early game starts the player in the <span class="italic">Undead Asylum</span>, where they are freed by <span class="bold">Oscar of Astora</span> before making their way through the halls. They will then encounter the tutorial boss, the <span class="bold">Asylum Demon</span>, who will prove to be their first major challenge. After defeating the demon, the player will then make pilgrammage to <span class="italic">Firelink Shrine</span>, the hub world for the rest of the game. From there, the player will have to choose which path to follow. There are three main options from Firelink Shrine:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Undead Parish</li>
				<li>The Catacombs</li>
				<li>New Londo Ruins</li>
			</ol>


			<p>If the player has the master key and goes to <span class="italic">New Londo</span>, they can also immediately access:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Valley of the Drakes</li>
					<li>Blighttown</li>
				</ol>


			<p>After defeating the <span class="bold">Bell Gargoyles</span> in the <span class="italic">Undead Parish</span> and <span class="bold">Quelaag</span> at the bottom of <span class="italic">Blighttown</span> to ring the bells of awakening, the player will have to endure the traps and ambushes at <span class="italic">Sen's Fortress</span>. After navigating the maze, at the very top of the fortress is the final early game boss, the <span class="bold">Iron Golem</span>.</p>

			<h2>Mid Game</h2>
			<p>After defeating the <span class="bold">Iron Golem</span>, the player can then ascend to Anor Londo, City of the Gods. Once the player makes their way through the defences of the city, they will end up inside the palace of <span class="bold italic">Gwyn, Lord of Cinder</span>. Gwyn is not here though. Instead, the player must face off against the two knights guarding the Lordvessel, <span class="bold">Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough</span>.</p>

			<p>After defeating the duo, the player will then acheive the Lordvessel and make it possible to teleport to many previous checkpoints in the game, making it easy to travel the land in search of the four lords to retrieve the shards of Gwyn's soul.</p>
			<a id="lategame"></a>
			<h2>Late Game</h2>
			<p>Dark Souls has four endgame bosses, those being:</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square">
				<li>Seath the Scaleless</li>
				<li>Nito, First of the Dead</li>
				<li>The Bed of Chaos</li>
				<li>The Four Kings of New Londo</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The player must journey through four unique areas to fight these bosses, each with different landscapes and enemies to match their rulers. After defeating these four foes, you will use their powerful souls to travel to the <span class="italic">Kiln of the First Flame</span> and be tasked with your final battle to take down <span class="bold italic">Gwyn, Lord of Cinder</span>.</p>
