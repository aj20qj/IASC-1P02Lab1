			<h2>Early Game</h2>
			<p><strong>Dark Souls'</strong> early game starts the player in the <em>Undead Asylum</em>, where they are freed by <strong>Oscar of Astora</strong> before making their way through the halls. They will then encounter the tutorial boss, the <strong>Asylum Demon</strong>, who will prove to be their first major challenge. After defeating the demon, the player will then make pilgrammage to <em>Firelink Shrine</em>, the hub world for the rest of the game. From there, the player will have to choose which path to follow. There are three main options from Firelink Shrine:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Undead Parish</li>
				<li>The Catacombs</li>
				<li>New Londo Ruins</li>
				<li style="list-style-type:none">
					<ul>
						<li style="list-style-type:none">If the player has the master key and go to New Londo, they can also immediately access:</li>
						<li style="list-style-type:none">
							<ul>
								<li>Valley of the Drakes</li>
								<li>Blighttown</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After defeating the <strong>Bell Gargoyles</strong> in the <em>Undead Parish</em> and <strong>Quelaag</strong> at the bottom of <em>Blighttown</em>, the player will have to endure the traps and ambushes at <em>Sen's Fortress</em>. After navigating the maze, at the very top of the fortress is the final early game boss, the <strong>Iron Golem</strong>.</p>

				<li>The Bed of Chaos</li>
