Once defeated, the lava lowers to reveal many Taurus and Capra demons to fight in the ancient ruins. After getting through to the large door, the player may take the Daughter of Chaos shortcut to Lost Izalith by donating 30 humanity to the chaos covenant. Otherwise, the player must take on the Demon Firesage, the first of all demons, before facing the Centipede Demon in the lava lake below.

			<p>The ancient city of Lost Izalith is a lava lake with large, crumbling buildings surrounded by half-dragon creatures filling the lake. Once past the fiery cesspool, the Chosen Undead fights their way up the palace remparts until they have reached the peak. After sliding down into the arena, the player is faced with the Bed of Chaos, mother of all demons. The player must avoid the branch-like arms and holes opening up in the floor as they take out both arms before leaping into the heart of the beast. Once inside, the player slays the Chaos Bug controlling the Bed of Chaos and puts it to rest for good.</p>

Once the player makes their way into the bottom of the catacombs by using the bridge mechanisms inside, they will face off against the abomination Pinwheel who is a necromancer that was merged together with his wife and child. After defeating Pinwheel, the player will receive the Rite of Kindling which allows them to kindle bonfires to +4 and give the player 20 estus flasks to heal with. This triumph also unlocks arguably the most difficult area of the game, the Tomb of the Giants.</p>

The player can use a light source such as the skull lantern or the sunlight maggot to see better, but otherwise are left in absolute darkness. Giant and giant-dog skeletons litter every corner of this abyss, including archers who can easily catch the player off guard and knock them off into the many pits within the tomb. After reaching the bottom, the player will finally find light once again as Ash Lake becomes visible on a cliffside path. Once back inside, the player will come up against Nito, the First of the Dead. Nito is accompanied by ressurecting skeletons that can only be killed with holy weapons. Once defeated, Nito drops his lord soul and finishes the player's quest to obtain all four great souls.</p>

The Kiln is where Gwyn once relinked the first flame long ago, and to get there the player must face off against four of Gwyn's black knights that fought against the Bed of Chaos. After defeating them and making their way to the kiln, the Chosen Undead comes face to face with the Lord of Cinder, Gwyn. He is hollowed and animalistic, attacking the player with furious strikes. It is clear Gwyn is not at his full strength, as the Chosen Undead puts him to rest and completes their journey. Will the Chosen Undead link the first flame once again, or perhaps attempt to end the cycle? That much is for you to decide.</p>

In the wood lies many Oolacile forest residents and stone knights that are eerily similar to the ones found in Darkroot Garden. Optionally, the player will fight the ancient Black Dragon Kalameet. To do so, the player must be attacked by Kalameet in the basin and then talk to Gough in Oolacile to get an incredible cinematic. The fight against the Dragon of Calamity will pose the most signficiant challenge so far, and test the patience of players. Otherwise, the player will take on the fabled hero of the DLC, Knight Artorias. Artorias has been corrupted by the abyss, his right arm broken and unable to wield his greatshield. Instead, Artorias uses extreme agility and power by one-handing his greatsword in an epic duel between two great warriors. After the dust settles, the Wolf Knight is slain and the player will gain access to the Oolacile Township.</p>

			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>The Chasm of the Abyss is a dark, dingy cavern filled with traces of dark magic and evil. Humanity sprites populate the otherwise empty caves as the player makes their way closer and closer towards the source of the Abyss. There is a secret portion of the cave in which the player can rescue Sif the Great Grey Wolf, as she is found protected by Artorias' greatshield. When they reach the source, the Chosen Undead is confronted by the one and only Manus, Father of the Abyss. Manus has an incredibly fast moveset for how big he his, with hard hitting combos and ranged attacks. After dodging through his swings and dark magic, the player finally defeats Manus and puts his soul to rest. In turn they rescue Princess Dusk who is unconcious and unable to recall your heroic act. After Dusk is saved, the player heads back to Elizabeth to divulge the details and collect their reward before heading back to current day Lordran.</p>
